1. Always validate and sanitize user input.
2. Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords). Use os.getenv().
3. Use clear variable names and snake_case (e.g., user_id, not x).
4. Keep functions short (<= 50 lines).
5. Prefer early returns over deep nesting to improve readability.
6. Add docstrings for all functions explaining what they do.
